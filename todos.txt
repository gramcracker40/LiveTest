Fix the API call for Registering the teacher. Getting an "Interal Server Error"

Done --> Change the Create Course variables to be more specific about a course 
and the information needed. 
EX: There can be multiple classes with the same course number. 
So either we have to use the course number and the section number or 
we need to use the CRN number. If we are using the CRN number then 
the data base needs to add that and take out the "Course" number

See Schemas in swagger docs, will explain the "Course variables" a lot better. Each route depends
one of the schemas listed there. 

No type safety--> Also an opinion is that the values for Course number and year should be strings
