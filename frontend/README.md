# frontend of LiveTest
  I'm really a backend dev who learned React with this project to showcase my Python research a little easier and better with React. This code can be optimized a ton... and structured way better, needs some work. but feel free to run it and test out the web app after starting the backend and getting some fake data created using backend/testing/db_startup_sim.py. Super helpful script for simulating a school.

# /app
  vite react Vanilla JavaScript application

# /deploy
  dockerfiles for building and running frontend in dev and prod
