Ah, I see what you mean, Terry. My apologies for the oversight. To deal with rotated scantrons, we need a more robust way to find the contours, identify the four corners of the scantron sheet, and then perform a perspective transform to get it into a "bird's-eye view" before normalizing it.

Here's how to accomplish this:

### Improved Isolation with Perspective Transformation

First, we'll improve the isolation function by capturing the four corner points of the largest contour, and then applying a perspective transformation:

```python
def four_point_transform(image, pts):
    rect = np.array(pts, dtype = "float32")
    
    (tl, tr, br, bl) = rect
    
    # Compute the width and height
    widthA = np.sqrt(((br[0] - bl[0]) ** 2) + ((br[1] - bl[1]) ** 2))
    widthB = np.sqrt(((tr[0] - tl[0]) ** 2) + ((tr[1] - tl[1]) ** 2))
    heightA = np.sqrt(((tr[0] - br[0]) ** 2) + ((tr[1] - br[1]) ** 2))
    heightB = np.sqrt(((tl[0] - bl[0]) ** 2) + ((tl[1] - bl[1]) ** 2))
    
    maxWidth = max(int(widthA), int(widthB))
    maxHeight = max(int(heightA), int(heightB))
    
    dst = np.array([
        [0, 0],
        [maxWidth - 1, 0],
        [maxWidth - 1, maxHeight - 1],
        [0, maxHeight - 1]], dtype = "float32")
    
    M = cv2.getPerspectiveTransform(rect, dst)
    warped = cv2.warpPerspective(image, M, (maxWidth, maxHeight))
    
    return warped

def improved_isolate(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)
    edged = cv2.Canny(blurred, 75, 200)
    
    cnts, _ = cv2.findContours(edged.copy(), cv2.RETR_LIST, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    cnts = sorted(cnts, key = cv2.contourArea, reverse = True)[:5]
    
    for c in cnts:
        peri = cv2.arcLength(c, True)
        approx = cv2.approxPolyDP(c, 0.02 * peri, True)
        
        if len(approx) == 4:
            screenCnt = approx
            break
    
    warped = four_point_transform(image, screenCnt.reshape(4, 2))
    return warped
```

### Example Usage

You'd use these new functions in the same way as the earlier ones:

```python
# Improved isolation
improved_cropped_img = improved_isolate('rotated_scantron.jpg')

# No need for the rotate_scantron function anymore due to perspective transform
# Normalization
normalized_img = normalize_scantron(improved_cropped_img)

cv2.imshow('Normalized Scantron', normalized_img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

In this improved approach, we look for a contour with exactly four points after approximating it. We assume that this contour corresponds to the edges of the scantron sheet. We then use these four points to perform a perspective warp and get the scantron in a bird's-eye view, which should be orthogonal to the image borders.

Let me know how this works out for you!
