Hey Terry,

Sounds like a cool project! Automating Scantron answer detection could have some useful applications, especially in a university setting. Given your CS background, I bet you'll have a blast working on this. Below are the steps to accomplish your goals using Python with OpenCV and NumPy:

### Pre-requisites

First, you'll need to install the required packages, if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

### Step 1: Isolate the Scantron from the Image

We can use contour detection to isolate the Scantron. OpenCV has a `findContours` function that will help you identify the shape of the Scantron.

Here's a snippet:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def isolate_scantron(image_path):
    # Read the image
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    
    # Convert the image to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Use GaussianBlur to reduce noise and improve contour detection
    blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)
    
    # Use Canny edge detection
    edged = cv2.Canny(blurred, 30, 150)
    
    # Find contours
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(edged, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    
    # Sort the contours by area in descending order and keep the largest one
    contours = sorted(contours, key=cv2.contourArea, reverse=True)[:1]
    
    # Extract coordinates of the largest contour
    x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contours[0])
    
    # Crop the image
    cropped_img = img[y:y+h, x:x+w]
    
    return cropped_img

# Usage
cropped_img = isolate_scantron('scantron_image.jpg')
cv2.imshow('Cropped Scantron', cropped_img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Step 2: Rotate the Scantron

You can find the rotation angle by using `minAreaRect` on the contour. Then, rotate the image using `getRotationMatrix2D` and `warpAffine`.

Here's how:

```python
def rotate_scantron(cropped_img):
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(cropped_img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)
    edged = cv2.Canny(blurred, 30, 150)
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(edged, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    
    # Find the angle
    _, _, angle = cv2.minAreaRect(contours[0])
    
    # Rotate the image back to being straight
    (h, w) = cropped_img.shape[:2]
    center = (w // 2, h // 2)
    M = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D(center, angle, 1.0)
    rotated = cv2.warpAffine(cropped_img, M, (w, h), flags=cv2.INTER_CUBIC)
    
    return rotated

# Usage
rotated_img = rotate_scantron(cropped_img)
cv2.imshow('Rotated Scantron', rotated_img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Step 3: Normalize the Size

You can resize the rotated image to a standard size using `resize`.

```python
def normalize_scantron(rotated_img, width=800, height=600):
    return cv2.resize(rotated_img, (width, height))

# Usage
normalized_img = normalize_scantron(rotated_img)
cv2.imshow('Normalized Scantron', normalized_img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Detecting Answers

After this, you can use techniques like HoughCircles or custom logic to identify the filled-in circles (i.e., answers).

I hope you find this walkthrough helpful. Feel free to modify these codes and incorporate them into your coursework or whatever you're working on. Let me know if you have more questions or run into any issues!
